# Knee-Arthroplasty-ML
Knee Arthroplasty Prediction


- *Premise*: Templating the appropriate size for total knee replacements allows for faster operative times, less economic costs, and decreased patient morbidity. However, templating is not universally performed as some believe it is less accurate and time-intensive. This leads to potentially worse patient outcomes and increased costs (longer operative times and device representatives having to bring a wide array of implant sizes)
- *Goal*: Use machine learning to accurately predict knee implant sizes using three, universally-collected variables (sex, height, weight)
Compare machine learning results to those of previous papers that utilized regression analysis. 
- *Methodology*: 
Comparative analysis between previous work and modern ML
- Potential Software/Programming Language: R
- Packages: H20 and Caret
- Potential ML: Treebased (RandomForest), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost and GBM), Deeplearning and Stacking/SuperLearner
- Timeline:  1 to 2 weeks to get initial. Kimaina and Freddy set tentative follow-up data of next Wednesday (12/11)
- *Dataset*: 
 Train with the previous training dataset (n=3407). Dataset they used to RETROspectively create regression (2017 paper: Can Demographic Variables Accurately Predict Component Sizing in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty?)
 Test with testing dataset (n=513). Dataset they used to PROspectively test their regression (2019 paper: Prospective Validation of a Demographically Based Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty Size Calculator)
